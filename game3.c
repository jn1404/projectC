// Instead of using a 2D array, we should make a binary tree.

// im guessing the game "CaseQuest"'s objective is to find some treasure and 
// open it, so i was also was wondering if you wanted to keep track of how many times 
// the player moved to keep some type of score. This part isn't important yet because 
// we still have to complete this part. 

// Also, we should reformat the story so that there is only a maximum of two 
// directions per "room". it makes it the code easier. 


// so we should map the game before we get the user input 
// i got help from benson for this part.
